# blogReviewApp

This is an app for making reviews for blogs. It has been first developed in the course [Full Stack open](https://fullstackopen.com/) and thus the whole commit history is not available. After the course, I have modified the app, mainly it's user interface, authentication logic and containerization.

The app backend is made with javascript and the frontend with React.
